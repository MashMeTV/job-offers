### Who are we?
mashme.io is revolutionizing the unified communication experience. We use leading technology to deliver simplified business communications, video conferencing, and always-on collaboration as the first credible alternative to an in-person meeting. We are a young and funny multinational team that are already blitzing our targets - and we show no sign of slowing down!

### What are we looking for?
In short, we are looking for a QA Engineer with at least 3 years experience in automated testing and stress testing. It is also important to have experience in designing and executing test plans, to be familiar with quality management, to be exigent and proactive in the quality assurance process and to always be willing to learn.
You will be able to work in our Madrid office or completely remotely.

### We will pay more attention to you if these topics look familiar to you (the most important first)
- Automatic test design.
- Selenium or similar.
- Webdriverio or similar.
- Appium or similar.
- Cucumber or similar.
- Knowledge of programming in JavaScript.
- Follow-up and closing of bugs (Jira).
- Git and git workflow knowledge.
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Jenkins and CI/CD workflows.
- Gcloud suite
- Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English


### What does our stack look like?
At the moment we have a hybrid architecture between monolith and microservices. We are moving to a complete microservice architecture. All our code is written in Node.js and Polymer, using MongoDB as the main storage system (although we would love to switch to PostgreSQL someday).

We use Docker to develop locally and Kubernetes for our production and quality control environments. For our development workflow we use GitHub as a code repository and code review and Jenkins as a CI pipeline. 

At the moment the vast majority of quality tests are passed manually and we are in the process of automating them (we would love to have you help us in this process).

Finally, we use Jira for project management.

### What we need from you
- Create new quality processes and improve existing ones.
- Help us write automatic tests.
- Track and close bugs.
- Help to increase the reliability of our services.
- Improve our monitoring and observability.
- Help us to reach Continuous Delivery.

### What we offer
- Negotiable salary
- Flexible schedule (always having in mind team compromises)
- Fun, young environment (We try to have as much as we can while getting things done)
- Cool tech stack (we love working with the latest technologies, or creating our own!)
- Some huge Harry Potter's fans (and some opponents)

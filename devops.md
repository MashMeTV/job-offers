### Who are we?
mashme.io is revolutionizing the unified communication experience. We use leading technology to deliver simplified business communications, video conferencing, and always-on collaboration as the first credible alternative to an in-person meeting. We are a young and funny multinational team that are already blitzing our targets - and we show no sign of slowing down!

### What are we looking for?
In short, we are looking for a passionate person with experience in DevOps methodologies. If building and maintaining thriving, reliable and distributed infrastructures along with continous integration and deployment pipelines excites you, you'll probably want to keep reading.

### We will pay more attention to you if these topics look familiar to you (the most important first)
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Git and git workflow knowledge
- GCloud suite
- Istio
- Jenkins and CI/CD workflows
- Obervability & monitoring
- Prometheus
- Multi-AZ deployments
- Microservices
- Blue/Green deployments, A/B testing, Canary releases...
- WebSockets
- RabbitMQ (or AMQP in general)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English


### What does our stack look like?
At this moment we have a hybrid architecture between monolith and microservices. We are thoroughly moving to a full microservices architecture and we would love to have you helping us. All of our code is written in Node.js at this moment and we use MongoDB as main storage system (we would love to move to PostgreSQL someday though).

We use Redis as a distributed real-time database and RabbitMQ for communications between services.

 We use Docker to develop locally and Kubernetes for our production and QA environments (We have just deployed multi region clusters. Yay!). For our development workflow we use GitHub as code repository and code review and Jenkins as CI pipeline. We also use Prometheus for monitoring (we have lot of work to do in this area though).

 Finally we use Jira for project management.

### What we need from you
- Help us getting to Zero Downtime
- Help us getting full insight of the platform status
- Improve our logging and tracing
- Help us getting to Continous Delivery

### What we offer
- You will be able to work either at our office in Madrid or fully remote.
- Negotiable salary
- Flexible schedule (always having in mind team compromises)
- Fun, young environment (We try to have as much fun as we can while getting things done)
- Cool tech stack (we love working with the latest technologies, or creating our own!)
- Some huge Harry Potter's fans (and some opponents)

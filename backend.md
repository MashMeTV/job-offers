### What are we looking for?
In short, we are looking for a backend developer with at least 3 years of experience working with software. The most important thing is that you are pasionate about writing code and building complex and robust architectures and you are always willing to learn.
You will be able to work either at our office in Madrid or fully remote.

### We will pay more attention to you if these topics look familiar to you (the most important first)
- Design software components
- Git and git workflow knowledge
- Node.js and/or MongoDB
- Writing unit tests (preferably using Jest)
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Microservices
- RabbitMQ (or AMQP in general)
- Redis
- Jenkins and CI/CD workflows
- TDD
- Gcloud suite
- WebSockets
- Selenium
- Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English


### What does our stack look like?
At this moment we have a hybrid architecture between monolith and microservices. We are thoroughly moving to a full microservices architecture and we would love to have you helping us. All the code is written in Node.js and we use MongoDB as main storage system (we would love to move to PostgreSQL someday though).

We use Redis as a distributed real-time database and RabbitMQ for communications between services.

 We use Docker to develop locally and Kubernetes for our production and QA environments (We have just deployed multi region clusters. Yay!). For our development workflow we use GitHub as code repository and code review and Jenkins as CI pipeline.

 Finally we use Jira for (?)

### What we need from you
- Help us writing clean code and empower good practices
- Help up increasing our services reliability
- Improve our monitoring and observability
- Help us getting to Continous Delivery

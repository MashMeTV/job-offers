## Who are we?
mashme.io is revolutionizing the unified communication experience. We use leading technology to deliver simplified business communications, video conferencing, and always-on collaboration as the first credible alternative to an in-person meeting. We are a young and funny multinational team that are already blitzing our targets - and we show no sign of slowing down.

## What does our stack look like?
Our backend code is written in Node.js and we use MongoDB as the main storage system.
We work with Redis/Memorystore as a distributed real-time database and RabbitMQ for communications between services.
Our solution is running on Google Cloud Platform, deployed mainly on GKE (Kubernetes) in multiple clusters.
You will develop locally on a dockerized environment, with GitHub as code repository and Jenkins as CI pipeline.
On mashme.io, we embrace the ‘you build it, you run it’ philosophy and you will be in charge of production deployments following GitOps with tools like Flux, Helm...

## What we need from you
The most important thing is that you are passionate about writing code and building complex and robust architectures and you are always willing to learn, writing clean code and empowering good practices.
Do you have experience in one or more of the main languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, …)? It doesn’t matter if your principal programming language isn’t JavaScript, but we need from you a good knowledge of functional and asynchronous programming, we need your code run distributed and efficiently all around the world.
In addition, we hope you like DevOps mindset as much as we do, if so, you will help us monitor and improve the reliability of our services running in production and add these for the early phases of development on the new ones.
Last but not least, as part of an international team we need you to feel comfortable communicating in English.

## Would be great if you…

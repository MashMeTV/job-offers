## Who are we?
mashme.io is revolutionizing the unified communication experience. We use leading technology to deliver simplified business communications, video conferencing, and always-on collaboration as the first credible alternative to an in-person meeting. We are a young and funny multinational team that are already blitzing our targets - and we show no sign of slowing down.

## What does our stack look like?
Our frontend code is based on Web Components made with Polymer (version 1 and 2) and Lit. These components are written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS (no preprocessors), keeping the three layers separately (people who write the CSS, they do it in separate CSS files). We use Web Component Tester and Karma for testing our Web Components. Currently, we have more than 200 tests.

We also have a custom middleware made with vanilla JavaScript so we don't have any dependencies with frameworks like Angular or React. 

You will develop locally on a dockerized environment, with GitHub as code repository and Jenkins as CI pipeline.

On mashme.io, we embrace the ‘you build it, you run it’ philosophy and you will be in charge of production deployments following GitOps with tools like Flux, Helm...

## What we need from you
The most important thing is that you are passionate about writing code and building complex and robust JavaScript applications following good practices that helping you to create and maintain an ecosystem putting all the pieces together. You also must have basic HTML knowledge.

If you don't have experience creating Web Components or you do but you don't know Polymer or Lit, it doesn't matter. We are trying to keep our platform agnostic in terms of what can we use and how we can use.

Last but not least, as part of an international team we need you to feel comfortable communicating in English.

## Would be great if you…
- Establish software architecture patterns.
- Have experience writing Web Components in any framework or library, or just using vanilla JavaScript.
- Have experience with the WebRTC stack.
- Have experience with common build tools.
- Have experience with Accessibility.

## What we offer
- Negotiable salary.
- You will be able to work fully remote. We have a long-standing culture of remote work.
- Flexible schedule (always having in mind team compromises) and intensive working day during August.
- Annual budget for training.
- Fun, young environment (We try to have as much as we can while getting things done).
- Cool tech stack (we love working with the latest technologies, or creating our own!).
